This project is a simple number guessing game; it generates a random number and tracks how many guesses it takes for users to get the number.
Next steps:
    Add warmer and colder features when the user gets closer or farther away from a number
    A feature to allow users to play again
    A key that allows users to exit game. If clicked, then a message will appear
    Timer
